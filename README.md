# Dice Data Visualization
Goal of project is to familiarize ourselves with python and matplotlib by creating multiple graphs and visualizations for dice rolls.
Phase one consists of 4 functional options
## Simulate
Simulate X amount of dice rolls of DXX dice. From there choose to download the data, graph the data, or both.

*Will use random, object orient programming, python*
## Graph from current data 
Using a file, take in all data, and correctly graph all data with visual appeal.

*Will improve with python use and understanding of matplotlib.*
## Collect Data or Play DND
Effectively a realtime monitor of dice rolls and by the end of the night, you can reliable how many critical success or failures your group encountered. 

*Will improve with python use and understanding of matplotlib.Perhaps for room to update graph in realtime which helps cement object oriented code.*
## Import Data
User enters file from which we can import and graph data. 

*Learn more about file management and user interface/input.*
## Notes
At some point, user should be able to pick which graphs they want displayed so they may extrapolate from the data. Could create an imperfect prediction model with algorithm, and potentially a neural net. Overall this project will improve our python competency, our version control knowledge,and our code etiquette.
